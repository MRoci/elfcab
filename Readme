simple experiments with ELF file format.

1.
===
injects shellcodes file into ELF executables using PT_NOTE to PT_LOAD technique.

- appends the shellcode at the end of the file
- converts the first PT_NOTE segment into PT_LOAD pointing to our shellcode with correct permissions
- modifies the program entrypoint to execute our shellcode first
- patches the shellcode to return to the original entrypoint

x64 only, works with PIE
